# Godot 4.5 Release

### Godot (an open source game engine) released update 4.5 today with a lot of exciting new features.

_The features I am most excited about are:_
- Stencil Buffering\
  Geometry that is not on screen can be written to a buffer, allowing for trippy effects like a door into a room that isn't there.
- Reworked animation controls\
  The new animation player will allow much more control over animation curves leading to smoother, more realisitic animation.
- In-script color picker\
  Quality of life feature for people like me who don't know color codes by heart
